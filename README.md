# Problem: 
People don't really have a platform where they can sell home cooked food to people who would want to buy home cooked food. People who want home cooked food may not have the time or necessary skills to cook the food themselves and with our platform those with the necessary skills will be able to curb this and make money off it by offering home cooked food at their residence. 

# Vision: 
We want to help people buy home cooked food, real home cooked food from the people around them on an online platform.

# Benefits: 
Buyers – buy home cooked food with convinience, cheaper and healthier than takeaway.
Cooks – make some money on the side.

# Deliverables:
This platform will be coded with the Android stack and will be location based that allows cookers to post the food they have made/about to make and the general public can choose to come to the cookers residence to buy the food and eat. They will pay through the app. 


# Gamification:
Star system based on how well they cook the food and how people like it.

# Machine Learning:
Recommendations based on what they like.

# Fin-tech:
Pay through the app.

# Features: 
Map with navigation
Profile system
Rating system
Payment system
Recommendation system
